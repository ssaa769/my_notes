首先登录上HTB，在个人用途里面找到靶场

注册然后登录，最开始的是Starting Point系列靶场。

首先要连接上去，下载它给的文件，用kali自带的openvpn工具连接：

`openvpn starting_point_orange33315.ovpn`

网页上提示在线，我们就可以初始化靶机了。

第一台靶机比较基础，问你一些问题，我整理在下面：

```
TARGET MACHINE IP ADDRESS

10.129.113.119

Read the walkthrough provided, to get a detailed guide on how to pwn this machine.

Task 1

What does the acronym VM stand for?

******* ******e
Virtual Machine

Task 2

What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell.

*******l
terminal

Task 3

What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?

******n
openvpn

Task 4

What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?

***g
ping

Task 5

What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target?

***p
nmap

Task 6

What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?

*****t
telnet

Task 7

What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?

***t
root

Submit Flag

Submit root flag
```

这台靶机只需要nmap扫出23端口，telnet用root登录一下即可，不多赘述。

## Fawn：

先扫一下：

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp

#加上-sV
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
```

很明显这台靶机就是关于ftp的

直接用`anonymous`匿名登录，ls发现有flag文件，直接get命令下载

问题如下:

```
Task 1

总结如下：

1. `nmap -sV`:查看端口上服务的版本信息
2. `namp -O`:查看主机的操作系统
3. ftp匿名登录的用户名:`anonymous`
4. ftp  -?显示帮助菜单
5. ftp  ls列出文件，get下载文件

## Dancing：

首先nmap扫描一下：

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
135/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds?
5985/tcp open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

发现445端口有SMB服务开放，我们使用`smbclient`工具。

先`smbclient -L`查看共享文件列表，然后直接连上去（无需密码）,找到flag文件即可

```

## Redeemer：

先扫描，扫出6379端口，运行的是redis服务。

redis也是一个数据库，特点是数据存放在**内存**中，存储的是键值对（非关系数据库）

一般作为其他传统数据库如Mysql的缓存

我们可以使用``redis-cli``官方命令行工具和redis进行交互
